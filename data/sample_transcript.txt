[Meeting Transcript]

Paul Borg: Good morning Simon, thanks for joining me today. I understand you're currently based in Saudi Arabia?

Simon Shaw: Yes, that's right Paul. I've been working here at NEOM for about 18 months now. Really enjoying the work but it's time to start thinking about the future.

Paul Borg: Absolutely. Let's start with some basic details. Can you confirm your full name and date of birth?

Simon Shaw: Sure, it's Simon James Shaw. Born 16th April 1970, so I'm 55 now.

Paul Borg: And what's your current role at NEOM?

Simon Shaw: I'm working on the Trojan Project. It's a major infrastructure development. My salary is 85,000 SAR per month, which works out to about $22,500 USD.

Paul Borg: That's a good income. Are you married?

Simon Shaw: No, divorced actually. It was finalized about 3 years ago. I have two children, both at university in Australia now.

Paul Borg: I see. And what are your main financial goals?

Simon Shaw: Well, primarily retirement planning. I'd like to retire at 65 and move back to Australia. I want to make sure I'm being tax-efficient with my savings while I'm here in Saudi.

Paul Borg: Makes sense. What assets do you currently have?

Simon Shaw: I've got a property in Queensland - bought it a few years back. Current value is around AUD $1.5 million but there's still a mortgage of about $1.1 million on it.

Paul Borg: Any pension or superannuation?

Simon Shaw: Yes, my Australian superannuation has about $320,000 in it, maybe $215,000 USD equivalent. It's been growing at around 6-7% annually.

Paul Borg: Good. And what about your nationality and residency status?

Simon Shaw: I'm Australian, currently resident in Saudi Arabia for work purposes. No dual nationality.

Paul Borg: Perfect. Let me note down your contact details...

Simon Shaw: My email is simon.shaw@email.com and mobile is +966 50 123 4567.

Paul Borg: Great. Any other goals besides retirement?

Simon Shaw: Yes, I'd like to help my kids with their education costs while they're at university. Also thinking about building up some savings for when I return to Australia.

Paul Borg: Understood. We'll work on a comprehensive plan for you. I'll send over some initial recommendations next week.

Simon Shaw: Sounds good Paul. Thanks for your time.
